## Background

[Bucky’s Data Viz Challenge](https://data.wisc.edu/love-data-week/buckys-data-viz-challenge/) is an annual data visualization competition put on by the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
One winner goes on to represent the Badgers at the annual [Big Ten Academic Alliance (BTAA) Data Viz Championship](https://btaa.org/technology/love-data-week/data-viz-student-championship).

The 2026 edition of the championship revolves around college fight songs (a rousing or rallying song used to gather enthusiasm or a sense of unity and pride for a sports team). 
The dataset of 65 songs, adapted from FiveThirtyEight's [Fight Song Dataset](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/fight-songs/fight-songs.csv), includes data points regarding various tropes present in the fight songs (saying the words "fight" or "rah," for instance), as well as musical attributes such as
tempo and duration. Also included is the origin of the song, including author, year written, and whether a contest took place to establish the fight song. Also included in the dataset is the Spotify ID of the song.
